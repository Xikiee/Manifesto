                Different approaches can be taken to avoid irresponsible design.
                It is important to note as mentioned in certain pages, that though these practices should be avoided, 
                they vary in importance and levels of deceit.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the easiest ways to avoid one of the larger forms of trickery is to not make up false claims. 
                This is expressed with reference to the packaging claiming to not be plastic. 
                Rather than making a false claim it would be better to not add anything at all.
                If no action is being taken to make a sustainability difference, then do not claim to be making that change.
                Picture of the normal product
            </p>
            <p>
                Another easy design change would be to remove the use of an extra cardboard casing when it is unnecessary. 
                The same amount of information can be added to the product itself such as the ingredients list, instructions, warnings, etc. 
                In most cases this is already the case, thus an extra box is unnecessary. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These solutions however only lead to normal plastic packaging. 
                If the goal is to promote the sustainability aspect of a product and appeal to a more environmental consumer, 
                other design choices can be made to still avoid greenwashing.
            </p>
            <p>
                An issue that comes from greenwashing is not only the aspect of getting people to buy more of the 
                product but also the issue relating to how it is disposed of due to their ambiguity. 
                Therefore a better design would be one that can make the product recyclable, and make it clear to the consumers how. 
                One of the mentioned greenwashing methods was to claim the large amount of paper/cardboard/paperboard 
                that the packaging is made out of, disregarding the fact that it is not recyclable and making it appear 
                to be by the average person. A possible solution is to design a packaging that separates the plastic 
                lining with the cardboard body. Make it clear how one can remove the plastic from the paper and dispose 
                of each piece the way it should. Through field testing by asking students of TU/e, those that claimed to care 
                about this aspect expressed how they would go out of their way to do this as they are often confused about how to 
                dispose of products with vague material.  
                Insert the design instruction
            </p>
            <p>
                An even better design change would be one that can change the behaviour of consumers. 
                Designing the product package to be refillable instead of one time use would create better environmental impacts. 
                Compared to the previous solution which reduces the amount of plastic used and increases recycling, 
                this method would not only decrease the amount of plastic waste, it would decrease the amount of materials 
                produced in general. According to R-strategies, though it is important to recycle, this is towards the bottom 
                of the ladder. Instead it is better to reduce (R2), reuse (R3). This solution incorporates this mindset. 
                Issues that arise from this would be the need for an equally good solution for transporting/selling the 
                refillables. This however is possible and is being done by cabinet health. 
                They use wood cellulose as their refillable in order to stay sustainable. 
                Though there is extra packaging created, if the refillable stock is a large amount, 
                this will overcome the amount of packaging created if the smaller individual product is bought in equal 
                amounts to the refill.
